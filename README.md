# Crystal
Crystalize What's Important in Life

## How To Use

1. Download all required dependencies with this
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.

2. And just run the app like this ```python3 app.py```.

**Note**: Cuda and Cudnn is required for this to work and we don't provide them (so you are on your own).
**Note**: Open an issue with any problem you face, we might help.


## News
- **14 May 2020** Added New Icon & integrated better Super-Resolution techniques

## Future Work
- [ ] Provide a working colab notebook in case there was problems in getting the site up.
- [ ] Consider making an API for developers.
- [ ] Add YouTube video downloading feaure.
- [ ] Add content in tour, explore .. pages.
- [ ] Optimize the code for faster inference.
- [x] Make a Dockerfile of the project for easy deployment.
- [ ] Deploy on a server with a good domain name.
